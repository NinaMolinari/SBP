# "Keeping Tabs" - a browser extension
## Small project for a Browser Extension, originally titled "SBP: Smart Browser Plugin".

I need a simple way to "keep tabs" on my tasks and work times spent in/using browser.
And, as the usual story goes, since I did not find any suitable browser extension fitting the purpose,
I am thus building one of my own Tasks/Tabs/Links tracker.
